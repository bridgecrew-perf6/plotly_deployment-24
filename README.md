# Belly Button Bacteria Biodiverity
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to create a github pages page where clients would be able to analyze data about the biodiversity of bacteria located in the navels of a selection of test subjects.  The end product is designed so that users interested in learning about these bacteria can easily navigate through the data of each of the test subjects in order to see trends.  Additionally, the test subjects were each given an ID number to hide their identities.  This will allow the test subjects to use the page in order to see the composition of bacteria in their own navels without compromising their privacy.  Finally, some styling was done to the layout and colors of the page in order to make the page more appealing.
